Problematic
Problem is I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit
Bad habits hard to break when I'm with you
Yeah, I know, I could do it on my own
But I want that real full moon black magic and it takes two
Problematic
Problem is when I'm with you, I'm an addict
And I need some relief, my skin in your teeth
Can't see the forest through the trees
Got me down on my knees, darlin' please, oh
I lose control
When you're not next to me (when you're not here with me)
I'm fallin' apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not next to me, mm-hm
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me, yeah
I lose control
When you're not here with me, mm
I'm fallin' apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not here with me, mm-hm
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me
